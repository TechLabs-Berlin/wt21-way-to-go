Project Summary - WayToGo 

WayToGo is a map based web application, that recommends interesting detour options based on data about popular Berlin routes and their surroundings. Through it's easy-to-use interface a user can choose from attractive icons what they feel like passing by today: historic sites, lots of green, cafes and restaurants ...? The app will then come up with data-driven route recommendations, that can be easily navigated on the integrated map, without being forwarded to another page.

In the Front-End, the project was mainly implemented with Create React App (using CSS, JS and HTML) and uses Google Maps API for displaying purposes. The beautiful design of the user interface with it's minimalistic icons and the repeating well matching colours was created in Figma. A Flask connected Back-End stores data and model predictions to be visualised on the map.

For the innovative approach of recommending routes classified by what a pedestrian could see while walking along our Data Science team integrated data about popular routes and data on points of interest in the whole city and applied several machine learning models for clustering and recommendation. Python with it's according libraries (Pandas, GeoPandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit Lean and more) were used for these purposes.

WayToGo was designed and implemented from scratch within eight weeks as a joint effort by TechLabs students from UX, Web Development and Data Science learning tracks.
