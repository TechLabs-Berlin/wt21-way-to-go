Project Summary - WayToGo 

WayToGo is a map based web application, that recommends interesting detour options based on data about popular Berlin routes and their surroundings. Through its easy-to-use interface, a user can input a starting point, a destination, and their preferenced route category from historic to amenities. The app will then provide data-driven route recommendations, that can be easily navigated on the integrated map, without being forwarded to another page.

UX researchers started to map out potential user needs and goals. In order to study target users, in-depth interviews have been conducted. With collected data, user stories and personas were created, and affinity mapping has been executed in Miro. Based on the user research, the prototype is designed in Figma with continuous communication with Frontend developers.

Frontend developers mainly implemented with Create React App (ReactJS, Java Script, CSS, Bootstrap, React-Bootstrap, React-Icons, React-Google-Maps, use-places-autocomplete, Axios, React Router, SweetAlert2) and use Google Maps API for displaying purposes. The beautiful design of the user interface with its minimalistic icons and the repeating well-matching colours was created in Figma. A Flask connected Back-End stores data and model predictions to be visualised on the map.

For the innovative approach of recommending routes classified by what a pedestrian could see while walking along our Data Science team integrated data about popular routes and data on points of interest in the entire city and applied several machine learning models for clustering and recommendation. Python with its according libraries (Pandas, GeoPandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit Lean and more) were used for these purposes.

WayToGo was designed and implemented from scratch within eight weeks as a joint effort by TechLabs students from the User Experience, Web Development and Data Science learning tracks.
