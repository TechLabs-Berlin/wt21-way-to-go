```

**2. Move to new directory**

```shell
cd wt21-way-to-go
```

**3. Install dependencies**

```shell
npm install
```

**4. Start up local development server**

```shell
npm start
```

**5. Run the app in the development mode**

```shell
http://localhost:3000
```

**6. Navigate into folder**

```shell
cd flask
```

**7. Create virtual environment**

## Deployment

Soon to be deployed

## Data

We have worked with data on popular routes and with data on points of interest, that pedestrians might want to look for when walking, both geographically constrained on Berlin and surroundings.

For obtaining the routes data, you need to scrape [wandermap.net](wandermap.net) on the query "Berlin".
The data on points of interest can be scraped from [OpenStreetMap.org](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_features)

For data visualisation, we used post code data from [suche-postleitzahl.org](https://www.suche-postleitzahl.org/plz-karte-erstellen), together with [Dr. Juan Camilo Orduz'wonderful Github repository and blogpost "Open Data: Germany Maps Viz"](https://juanitorduz.github.io/germany_plots/)
